Oreo v81 OS1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase",Well I was a bit sceptical before buying this Samsung Galaxy M10 soI bought thisphone on the second sale & placed the order for the variant ie3GB+32GB for ₹8990 Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings Few camera samples are also attached to thisreviewPros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 24Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 95/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 85/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box you will get the handset Chargingadapter USB cable Sim ejector tool and user manual# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variantit looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches I will suggest you buy a back cover# Display:- It is having 16CM (63) FHD+ Dewdrop full view displaywith broad 908% screen-to-body ratio 195:9 aspect ratio and 25DGorilla Glass it gives the screen a premium look The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery if you are a moderateuser it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings# Performance:- The M10 runs on 16 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor All the high-end games like PUBG Asphalt 9 Unkilled runsaverage You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi itsupports 24GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990 If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING) an okayish build & looks crisp and clear screen loud & crisp speakers a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phoneThis phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6 Redmi 6 pro etcI hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes The product is not up to the mark the built quality the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net Once it's sold as per them they can't helpCrux of the story from my side is don't go for it***Ordered this product in the First Sale And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment Phone Doesnt look or feel cheapPros:-1 price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2 Battery Life is Good3 Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4 front Camera Is good enought for selfies5 phone is light weightCons :-1 Rear Camera is not that great But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2 No headphones included3 Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone I just bought this to  review U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life Phone Works Great in day to day life exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks and Samsung Experience 95 feels snappyTechnoholic Life***Don't buy this phone Because phone itself switching off automatically This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in lookBattery performance is excellentSamsung did really good job in theme Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1  Display  touch response is excellent2  Wide angle camera is quite impressive3 Batter backup is great 4 Phone runs smooth5 Boot time is fastCons :1 No led light for notification and charging2 No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3 Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area4 Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings5 Front camera is shakky sometimes***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen1 Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range2 Poor body build3 You Tube videos shows blur even you play HD videos 4 Backup is not up to the mark It takes almost 35 hrs to recharge5 I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst So think read all T&C before going with this product***Excellent Phone in this budget I've gifted it to someone She likes it very much Ocean color is awesome Performance is also very good Light weighted Handy Phone***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***

I think that phone  has commandable for battery life***This phone looks very nice1) photos in day light or good light is awesome2) selfie flash is not good in dark you cant expect too much from front flash poor quality rear flash does good job3) portrait mode is also awesome in daylight (both front with AI and rear with second camera) but in low light quality is poor portrait mode doesn't supports flash4) you gets 12GB free out of 3 GB and 22GB out of 32GB5) face unlock and fingerprint does good job6) screen size is awesome and screen quality (picture quality) is goodI got this phone at effective price of 7200/- and its awesome product for this price overall photo quality is awesome in daylight and in good light but in low light quality reduces greatlyI am very happy with phone with effective price of 7200/-Dont buy its 4 GB Version other better products available at same cost  and buy only if you get on offer***If you want to buy a good phone within 10000 I am suggesting you this phone best camera plus everything is good Best thing no heating while playing PUBG 😂***Below are the issues1 When you join 3rd person on a call they won't listen when you talk (issue is with not with operator)2Heating issue when on phone on a charge3App Crash when you switch from one to another even with normal appsSo I have been talking to so called Amazon Technical Team and trying my best to convince to refund my money let's see how it goeshope they read my review and respond soon***Been using this phone since 3 months from now  happy with the performanceBattery back up and pic quality is goodOnly cons is that the face recognizion is a bit slow compared to other phones in market***=> DesignWell Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5 when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change  they are too similar This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal  I really miss glass finish at back of the phone So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone with just 3080mAh battery it perform well (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 95 with Android 81 which is very cool There are many good features Trust me It has excellent UI i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone Then it will good choice front camera is good  and it has good rear camera too But I am not very satisfied with camera because i compared it to some other phone of similar price range and i found they have much better camera  score (7/10)=> performanceYes It offer a lag free experience  It has good ram management  (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone but it is good phone because of its performance and software camera is good tooBut there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1 Great selfie camera2 Good performance- fast responses3 No heating issues4 Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1 Rear camera is not great But yes it does its job decently2 Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range3 Headset is not provided in the package The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt4 Fast charger is not provided But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers5 Speaker performance is not that great6 Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera***Totally waste dont buy  battery back up poordisplay not working sometime  Display quality not at all good***

I bought Moto G6 phone and I want to return that product because the body panel is not up to the mark It is very delicate Even camera is also not that much good But when I tried to return this product they would not allow me I asked them one question ie without seeing the product how can I assume that is good or bad?

service the product under warranty by saying that it's motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty Highly disappointed with the company attitude I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times
